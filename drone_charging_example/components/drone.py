        Protecting radius of drone.
    droneMovingEnergyConsumption: float
        The energy consumption per time-step for drone moving.

        The energy consumption per time-step for protecting/standing drone.
    battery: float
        The battery percentage of the drone.

    closestCharger: Charger
        the closest charger which is picked by pre-assignment ensemble.
    alert: float
        If computed battery is below this value, it is assumed a critical battery level.
    state: DroneState
        IDLE: a default state for drones.
        PROTECTING: when the drones are protecting the fields.
        MOVING_TO_CHARGER: when the drones are moving/queuing for a charger.
        CHARGING: when the drones are being charged.
        TERMINATED: when the drones' battery is 0, and they do not operate anymore.
